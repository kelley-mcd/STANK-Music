# STANK MUSIC

In this project we will work together as a group to build an application that searches and displays results from the Napster and Kanye.rest APIs.

# User Story

As a user, I want to listen to songs but not have to decide for myself as to what they are. 

As a user, I can either choose the "Let Kanye Decide" button which will give me a random Kanye inspired quote, a random song, and album art from the rapper/singer/ songwriter Kayne West.

As a user, the other option I have when I am greeted at the homepage is "Type in a random key word" which will let me type in any random word and I will then be given a song with that key word. 

# Acceptance Criteria

It is done when, I can navigate to a page that allows me to find music to listen to that has a polished UI.

It is done when, I click the "Let Kanye Decide" button I am greeted with a Quote and Picture of Kanye and a list of songs from him.

It is done when, I search for a song and am returned a new page with my requested search.

It is done when, My recent searches are saved locally for future viewing.
